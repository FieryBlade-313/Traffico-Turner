# Traffico-Turner
A simple game, Created in Unity. It contains a simple scripted AI to control cars.

## How the AI works.

Well the AI is pretty simple at the moment. There are few sensors placed in each car that tells it about the world. The cars use simple mathematics to -

- figure out there next __Destination__.
- to __prevent collision__ with other cars.

### Some important points.

- The AI is not made perfect as in the final game, I want the cars to collide sometimes.

## Future plans.

First thing I plan to do is to use Genetic Algorithm in the future to create a good AI.<br>
Improving the assets as I am using a simple cube for representing a car. Well for the moment there are two car variants that are currently in the game.

## Controls.

`esc` to quit.<br>
`spacebar` to apply handbrakes.<br>
`F` to change camera view.<br><br>

`W` or &#8593; to increase speed.<br>
`S` or &#8595; to decrease speed.<br>
`A` or &#8592; to steer left.<br>
`D` or &#8594; to steer right.<br>
